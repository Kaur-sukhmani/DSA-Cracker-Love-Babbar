# Linked List
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.


- **Link -** Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.
- **Next -** Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.
- **LinkedList -** A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

## Linked List Representation
Linked list can be visualized as a chain of nodes, where every node points to the next node.

## Uses of Linked List
- The list is not required to be contiguously present in the memory. The node can reside any where in the memory and linked together to make a list. This achieves optimized utilization of space.
- list size is limited to the memory size and doesn't need to be declared in advance.
- Empty node can not be present in the linked list.
- We can store values of primitive types or objects in the singly linked list.
